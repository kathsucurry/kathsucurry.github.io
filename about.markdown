<p>
Inspired by the work of so many incredible technical writers, I started this blog to share my journey and insights as I learn GPU programming.

I come from a background in computer science, biomedical informatics, and machine learningâ€”fields that continue to shape how I think and what I build.

When I'm not deep in code, you'll likely find me solving sudoku puzzles, crocheting something new, or watching anime.
